## 2024-05-15 - [Skip Links in Documentation]
**Learning:** In documentation sites with fixed sidebar navigation, a "Skip to main content" link is a critical accessibility requirement. Without it, keyboard-only users are forced to tab through the entire navigation menu on every page load before reaching the actual content.
**Action:** Always include a "Skip to main content" link at the beginning of the `<body>` in multi-page documentation templates with sidebar navigation.
